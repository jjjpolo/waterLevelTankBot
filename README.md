# Water Level Tank Bot
Based on a friend's need, this device provides a way to monitor the level of water in a tank using a water-proof ultrasonic sensor.

It keeps measuring the level of water that can be visualized through a web page (LAN only).

Aside from this, once the level of water reaches certain levels (known as triggers) it will send a message in a group/chat in telegram.
