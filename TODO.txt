add telegram config as part of tank settings page: - DONE

-add view elements to web page for - done
-add logic to process and receive them - WIP
    This might need work in the web page that send the JSOn since everything is working well with postman.
    It also might need work in the server:
        It seems that when len == total nothing especial is needed:
            len=67
            index=0
            total=67
        The additional work is when len is smaller than total:
            len=112
            index=0
            total=116
        However I wonder why this is not needed in postman. Let's ask chatgpt.
        yep it is needed so this might require documentation. 




-add a public method in the bot class to update chat id and token
    when this is running, disable/pause message sending
-implement config manager as part of bot settings page
    in case no config found disable message sending message
-This info should not be displayed in the web browser
    In case this is a pain consider any way to hide the input box in the webpage. 
    Maybe showing the input in blank and only processing it in case its content is not ""

Add mutex to tank and asyncwebserver, consider getters and setters.



add multi wifi handler


fix OTA constructor delegate that is wrong.
    consider adding setOTA instead of calling the default constructor.


Get rid of any Serial print in any constructor class.

Final release candidate!

Add references to ArduinoJson documentation to understand how to (for example):
-size a json
-avoid dangling pointer when deserializing
-serialize directly to a file.
-IT IS AWESOME DOCUMENTATION.
